OMNI TOOL v2.0

Homepage: TBA
Version: 2.0
Release Date: 10/3/2019

============================
		Introduction
============================

OMNI TOOL is just a collection of batch scripts that is designed to work with multiple command-line based programs.
Currently, the batch scripts incorporate the use of:

	1) Youtube-DL
		
		(https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)
	
	2) FFMPEG
	
		(http://ffmpeg.org/)
	
	3) giffer.sh (A modified unix shell executable file that specialises in making GIFs)
	
		(http://blog.pkh.me/p/21-high-quality-gif-with-ffmpeg.html)
	
	4) 'Modular' script design
	
		(My own design)
		
It is recommended that you download both Youtube-DL and FFMPEG before you use these scripts. They go in '00 Dependencies'
		
============================
		Dependencies
============================

Youtube-DL is usually included into the software pack. However, it requires that you download and install Python first for it to work.
You can do so here https://www.python.org/


FFMPEG has more complicated licensing terms, therefore it is not included the first time you download the software pack.
Also, because FFMPEG was designed to be compiled in a unix-like environment, Windows users can download a compiled version of it here https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/

If you wish, you can also add the '00 Dependencies' folder to your PATH. In case you did not however, Menu.bat has got you covered.
It will register '00 Dependencies' to PATH, but only when the Menu.bat script is running.

============================
		License
============================

These batch scripts are provided as is.

They are free for personal and commercial use. You may also modify it and redistribute it however you'd like (I wouldn't be able to stop you from doing so anyways, they're batch files). Provided that you do not redistribute it and claim it as your own with no change to the original script whatsoever.
